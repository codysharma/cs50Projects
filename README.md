# cs50Projects

Some of the projects from my cs50 class.

1) temps.c sorts an inbuilt array of cities and temperatures in descending order. Was practice in basic search alogrithms.
2) scrabble.c takes a word as input and outputs the Scrabble score. Practice in array comparisons and matching.
3) snackbar.c takes order items from inbuilt array and calculates a running total price.
4) reading levels contains two files which both compute the reading level of a string, one written in C and one in Python.
5) elections contains two programs, one which takes the number of voters and votes and returns the candidate with the plurality of votes. The other taking in candidates as arguments, the number of voters, and then asks voters to vote rank choice style. The function then eliminates last place candidates and reallocates the votes until a winner is determined.
6) dnaProject took in sample DNA fragments, compared characterisitcs, then searched for a math of a mysterious sample counting the occurence of subsequences within the larger sequences.
